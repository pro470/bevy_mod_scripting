## Summary 
### Script Systems
Script Systems get an overhaul, now supporting:
- Parallelisation & Ordering against any other rust or script system
    - Previously you could only order script systems against rust systems
- Parameterisation via `resource` and `query` builder functions
    - Exclusive and non-exclusive script systems are permissible, setting `exclusive` on the builder will allow the system to access anything like normal, but it will mean the system cannot be paralellised
    - Non-exclusive systems are only allowed to access the resources and queries they declared, this is why we can parallelise them like normal bevy systems
    - The pre-declared resource references and query results are passed in as arguments to the provided system handler
e.g.:

```lua
function on_init()
  local my_system = world.add_system(
      post_update_schedule,
      system_builder("my_parameterised_system", script_id)
          :resource(ResourceTypeA)
          :query(world.query():component(ComponentA):component(ComponentB))
          :resource(ResourceTypeB)
  )
end

function my_parameterised_system(resourceA,query,resourceB)
    print(resourceA, query, resourceB)
    for i,result in pairs(query) do
        components = result:components()
        assert(#components == 2)
    end
end
```

### Type Cache
A `types` global is now exposed containing all of the types found in the type registry:

```lua
-- instead of:
world.get_type_by_name("MyType")
-- you can use:
types.MyType
```

### LAD Global Improvements
The LAD format now supports arbitrary `TypedThrough` types as global instances.

The the mdbook pre-processor globals page got some love and now inlines links to each type as well as splits up the section to be more readable:

### Other
- Fixed issue where unit enum variants would be converted to `nil`
- `ScriptComponent` now implements `Reflect` (Thanks @Peepo-Juice)
