## Summary 

### :sparkles: Dynamic Components
To compliment dynamic systems introduced in the previous updates, scripts can now register their own, fully legit bevy components!

```lua
local NewComponent = world.register_new_component("ScriptComponentA")

local new_entity = world.spawn()
world.insert_component(new_entity, NewComponent, construct(types.DynamicComponent, {
    data = "Hello World"
}))

local component_instance = world.get_component(new_entity, NewComponent)
assert(component_instance.data == "Hello World", "unexpected value: " .. component_instance.data)

component_instance.data = {
    foo = "bar"
}

assert(component_instance.data.foo == "bar", "unexpected value: " .. component_instance.data.foo)
```

These are backed by the `DynamicComponent` type which looks like this:
```rust
pub struct DynamicComponent {
    data: ScriptValue,
}
```
scripts can freely set this data payload to anything that is supported by `ScriptValue`'s !.

These can also be queried as normal!

### Mdbook Preprocessor Prettified
The documentation you can generate via exported `ladfile`s now looks much better, types have nested links to other types, and things generally look better!

### Storing lua closures
The conversion from `mlua::Function` to `ScriptValue` is now supported, and as such you can store arbitrary lua callbacks through reflection in your `components/resources` (being careful not to unload scripts while these are being used, as it will likely cause panics in mlua)

### Continous Benchmarking
BMS now runs and publishes the results of a variety of benchmarks over at [bencher](https://bencher.dev/console/projects/bms/plots)

### Performance & Profiling Improvements
You can now easilly profile BMS using the new `profile_with_tracy` feature which will also enable bevy's equivalent. Tracing spans have generally been improved, giving you lots of great detail into where most time is spent!

The `get` and `set` indexer functions have been extracted into a `MagicFunctions` sub-registry to improve the performance of reflection.

Various internal hashmaps have been tuned to get free performance wins.

### Other
- Various missing getters and setters have been added to the `Scripts` resource.
- ScriptValue printing has been improved when nested in reflected types
