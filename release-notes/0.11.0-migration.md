# Migrating to BMS 0.11.0

### Removal of custom `get` and `set` overrides
If you were previously registering custom `get` or `set` functions on specific types, 
these will no longer be searched for by the `lua` and `rhai` implementations. 

If this is a wanted feature, let us know and we might bring it back!

If you are a language implementor, you will need to transition to calling the mini-registry for these.

### Calling `get` and `set` directly in scripts
Since these have been removed from bindings and moved into an easier to access sub-registry, which is not accessible to scripts directly
if you used these directly in scripts, i.e. with `my_type:get("field")`, you will have to migrate to the native syntax:
i.e.:
```lua
my_type.field
my_type["field"]
my_type["1"]
my_type._1
```
However `map_get` and other `ReflectReference` functions remain where they used to.


Happy migrating!
