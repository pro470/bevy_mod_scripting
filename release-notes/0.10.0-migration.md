# Migrating from 0.9 to 0.10

## Change in script re-load behavior https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/345

Scripts now retain state on a re-load. This means any globals created in a script should be re-computed when it is loaded using `on_script_loaded`

## `ScriptContexts` resource removed https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/350

Change all references from `ScriptContexts.contexts` to `Scripts<T>.scripts.context`

Language implementations must provide an internal mutability mechanism for their runtimes, and change &mut references to & on references to them in handlers

## Removal of some internal macros https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/367

A number of internal macros was made private as part of an effort to clean up BMS imports.

If you were using these you will need to re-implement those yourself.

## Changes to `GetTypeDependencies` trait https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/369

- Any types which you implemented `GetTypeDependencies` for manually, will need to specify an underlying type, for non-generic types this will just be Self, for types which have recursive registrations, this will be `Self<T1::Underlying, T2::Underlying...>` etc
- You can use the derive macro to make this easier instead

## Addition of global type cache

You should replace all your `world.get_type_by_name("MyType")` calls with `types.MyType` etc.
get type by name was not removed but it might be deprecated in the future.
