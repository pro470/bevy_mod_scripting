## Summary 

### Fine grained imports & BMSPlugin
`BMSPlugin` is now all you need to add to your app following the selection of the features you care about:
```rust
  app.add_plugins(BMSPlugin);
```
Since this is a plugin group, you can also override any individual plugins that make up `BMS` by using `.set` i.e.:
```rust
  app.add_plugins(BMSPlugin.set(CoreScriptGlobalsPlugin::default()));
```

The `bevy_bindings` feature flag has been replaced by fine-grained feature flags for each bevy module which contains the generated bindings corresponding to the upstream crate.
The script functions plugin now automatically registers the bindings according to these feature flags. This should help cut down on compilation times, and control bindings.

The `CoreScriptGlobalsPlugin` now also stores options for filtering registered globals, which can be changed.

### Callback responses
It is now possible to request that a `ScriptCallbackResponseEvent` event is emitted on custom callbacks. 

You can do this at the time of creation of `ScriptCallbackEvent` triggers like so:
```rust
ScriptCallbackEvent::new_for_all(YourCallbackLabel, vec![my_arg])
 .with_response();
```

### Optimisations
- `ScriptValue` is reduced in size to 64 bytes, improving performance all-around
- `ReflectReference` was refactored internally, to make slightly more sense
- Script loading performance benchmarks have been added

### Fixes
- since `0.11.0` the crate has silently been pulling in `mlua` with the `lua54` feature, which meant you could not select another lua version. This has been fixed
- the bug, causing the `GetTypeDependencies` derive macro to use the wrong path for `bms_core` had been fixed (thanks @shanecelis)
### Other
- Calls using the script's entity when it's not available will now error, the error will point the user towards resolution helpfuly.

## Changelog
See a detailed changelog [here](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Migration Guide
Stop registering individual plugins like `ScriptFunctionsPlugin` and `LuaScriptingPlugin` and instead register `BMSPlugin`.

If you did not want to include bevy bindings, make sure to disable the feature flags by using BMS without default features, similarly for the core functions.

Any customisations to sub-plugins can be performed as usual through the plugin group's `.set(PluginName::default()...)`.

The feature flag bevy_bindings is replaced by the fine grained feature flags for each bevy module, replace usages of this flag with all the modules you expect to use in scripts.
